                            ACID Properties in DBMS

                               A = Atomicity
                               C = Consistency
                               I = Isolation
                               D = Durability



ATOMICITY --> The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.

CONSISTENCY --> The database must be consistent before and after the transaction.

ISOLATION --> Multiple Transactions occur independently without interference.

DURABILITY --> The changes of a successful transaction accurs even if the system failure occurs.



Atomicity:
By this, we mean that either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn’t happen at all. 
There is no midway i.e. transactions do not occur partially. Each transaction is considered as one unit and 
either runs to completion or is not executed at all. It involves the following two operations. 
—Abort: If a transaction aborts, changes made to the database are not visible. 
—Commit: If a transaction commits, changes made are visible. 
Atomicity is also known as the ‘All or nothing rule’. 



Consistency:
This means that integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and 
after the transaction. It refers to the correctness of a database. Referring to the example above, 
The total amount before and after the transaction must be maintained. 
Total before T occurs = 500 + 200 = 700. 
Total after T occurs = 400 + 300 = 700. 
Therefore, the database is consistent. Inconsistency occurs in case T1 completes but T2 fails. As a result, T is incomplete. 


Isolation:
This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency 
of the database state. Transactions occur independently without interference. Changes occurring in a particular 
transaction will not be visible to any other transaction until that particular change in that transaction is written 
to memory or has been committed. This property ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently will result in a 
state that is equivalent to a state achieved these were executed serially in some order. 


Durability: 
This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database 
are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs. These updates now become permanent 
and are stored in non-volatile memory. The effects of the transaction, thus, are never lost.
